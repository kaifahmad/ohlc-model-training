## Example Usage

```python
# Code Generated by Sidekick is for learning and experimentation purposes only.
# Load OHLC data
data = load_ohlc_data('historical_data.csv')

# Feature engineering
features = generate_technical_indicators(data)

# Train a model
model = train_model(features, target='next_day_close')

# Evaluate performance
evaluate_model(model, test_data)
